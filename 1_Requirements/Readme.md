# Requirements
## INTRODUCTION

* This project aims to build a an "Assessment Platform" which consists of Quizes on 3 sections namely- 1) Aptitude 2) Verbal 3) Fundamentals of C.  MCQ type questions are asked to each user and based on the answer marks are provided with negative marking scheme. Each section being an elimination round, the one who makes up to clear all the section qualifies the assessment.

* The program also has the subtask of 'CANDIDATE REGISTRATION', 'INSTRUCTIONS' and 'EXIT THE PROGRAM'.

## Cost and Features
* low-cost 
* Approx. 300 line of code.
* Application designed is interactive and user friendly.
* Simple and easy to use.
* Easy to modify.
* There is a scorecard which will be generated at the end.

## Research
* Content for the Quiz.
* File handling.


# 'SWOT' ANALYSIS
### Strengths
* The project uses dynamic memory allocation.
* Candidate id is automatically generated in Registration task.
* Since the program uses File handling, questions can be added into the file.
* The Program can be easily modified. (For ex. Number of sections can be added.)
* The scoring system adopted is fairly simple enabling easy calculation of marks.
* Correct answer of the questions can be known.

### Weaknesses
* Program is not GUI based so every correct answer options needs to be typed.

### Oppurtunities
* The program can be made GUI based.
* Time based constraints can be added.

### Threats
* No Time based constraints.
* the program may terminate due to some incorrect user inputs.


### 4W's and 1'H
## Who:
# Who are the stakeholders ?

1. Any person or a member of the STEPin program willing to take up the quiz and find out if he/she is GENESIS ready.
2. The quiz is based on general concepts and not specific to any particular domain. 
## What:
# What does the project do ?

1. The project aims at generating a quiz assessment program which is input/output based depicting the score of the participant.
2. The participant has to qualifiy a minimum score.
## When:
# When will it get completed ?

The Project will be completed by 14th July 2021.
## Where:
# Where is the project done ?

The Project is implemented on C program platform based on Input/Output.
## How:
# How to achieve the Target ?

To achieve the target
    1. A good knowledge in file handling in C is a must.
    2. Basic input output based functions
    3. Proficiency in Structures and pointers.
    4. A good knowlwdge of Switch case and Dynamic Memory Management
