# Requirements
## INTRODUCTION

* This project aims to build a an "Assessment Platform" which consists of Quizes on 3 sections namely- 1) Aptitude 2) Verbal 3) Fundamentals of C.  MCQ type questions are asked to each user and based on the answer marks are provided with negative marking scheme. Each section being an elimination round, the one who makes up to clear the last section qualifies the assessment.

* The program also has the subtask of 'CANDIDATE REGISTRATION', 'INSTRUCTIONS' and 'EXIT THE PROGRAM'.

## Cost and Features
* Approx. 300 line of code.
* Application designed is interactive and user friendly.
* Simple and easy to use.
* Easy to modify.
* There is a scorecard which will be generated at the end.

## Research
* Content for the Quiz.
* File handling.


# 'SWOT' ANALYSIS
### Strengths
* Since the program uses File handling, questions can be added into the file.
* The Program can be easily modified. (For ex. Number of sections can be added.)
* The scoring system adopted is fairly simple enabling easy calculation of marks.
* Correct answer of the questions can be known.

### Weaknesses
* Program is not GUI based so every correct answer options needs to be typed.

### Oppurtunities
* The program can be made GUI based.
* Time based constraints can be added.

### Threats
* No Time based constraints.
* the program may terminate due to some incorrect user inputs.
